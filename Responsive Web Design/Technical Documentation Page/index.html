      <p>Java is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile applications (especially Android apps), and large systems. It is known for its robustness, portability, and security. The language emphasizes performance and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale applications.</p>
      <p>The Java ecosystem includes a rich set of libraries and frameworks that support various functionalities. Tools like Spring and Hibernate enhance Java’s capability in web and enterprise applications. Java’s strong memory management, multi-threading capabilities, and automatic garbage collection make it a preferred choice for many developers.</p>
      <code>
      public class HelloWorld {<br>
          public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
              System.out.println("Hello, World!");<br>
          }<br>
      } <br>

      <header>JavaScript</header>
      <p>JavaScript can be used on both the client side and the server side (with environments like Node.js). It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more. JavaScript’s non-blocking, event-driven nature makes it ideal for creating interactive and real-time web applications.</p>
      <p>The language is constantly evolving, with new features and improvements being added through ECMAScript specifications. JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue.js have further expanded its capabilities, enabling developers to build complex and efficient web applications.</p>

      <header>HTML</header>
      <p>HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows embedding of images and objects and can be used to create interactive forms. It is often used in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to create visually appealing and dynamic web pages.</p>
      <p>HTML5, the latest version, introduced new elements and attributes, providing more powerful tools for web developers. It supports multimedia content, including audio and video, and offers better error handling and improved performance.</p>

        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
        &lt;html&gt;<br>
        &lt;head&gt;<br>
            &lt;title>Hello, World!&lt;/title&gt;<br>
        &lt;/head><br>
        &lt;body><br>
            &lt;h1>Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;<br>

      <header>CSS</header>
      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
      <p>CSS enables the separation of content from design, allowing for more flexibility and control in the presentation characteristics of web pages. It allows for multiple pages to share formatting, reducing complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
      <code>
        body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
h1 {
    color: blue;
}
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>Controls the presentation of web pages</li>
        <li>Enables separation of content and design</li>

      <p> Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. Ruby is known for its flexibility and is often used for web development, particularly with the Ruby on Rails framework.</p>
      <p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Its clean and concise syntax makes it a favorite among developers for scripting and rapid prototyping.</p>
